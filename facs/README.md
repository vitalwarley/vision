# FACS

This project main purpose is to drive me to learn more about micro-expressions, more specifically about the [Facial Action Coding System](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Facial_Action_Coding_System).

> Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a system to taxonomize human facial movements by their appearance on the face, based on a system originally developed by a Swedish anatomist named Carl-Herman Hjortsjö. It was later adopted by Paul Ekman and Wallace V. Friesen, and published in 1978. [...] Movements of individual facial muscles are encoded by FACS from slight different instant changes in facial appearance. It is a common standard to systematically categorize the physical expression of emotions, and it has proven useful to psychologists and to animators. &mdash; <cite>Wikipedia<sup>[1]</sup></cite>

[This](https://cmu.app.box.com/s/4jb7xn5eb1qaddhr4w8bgt0lrieclehx/file/414124001528) this is nice.

## Questions

1. Could computer models ~understand~ detect emotions from facial expressions?
2. What is its state of the art?
3. What are the applications, if any?
4. What key concepts should I know?
6. What datasets can be used, if there is room for work there?
7. How can I start?
8. What questions am I **missing**?
